Please give me feedback!

These are 2 solutions to the same problem.
Please give me all the feedback you can think of, like:

    Bad naming
    Bad functions
    Hard to understand
    Missing coding philosophies and important priciples

I don't mind harsh feedback! I want to learn, and to learn you must humble and able to listen to people better than you. Thank you so much if you decide to help! <3
